# video-hoster
Made this video hoster to watch videos on my tablet. Automatically refreshes for media every 10 seconds, has a dropdown to select video. Anything inside the `/public` folder will be shared over port `8000`.
## Running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/linuxnoodle/video-hoster && cd video-hoster && npm i && npm run start
```
